# Timoshenko / Euler–Bernoulli Cantilever Beam — Galerkin FEM

Finite-element Galerkin formulation for a cantilever beam based on the
Timoshenko theory (with optional Euler–Bernoulli comparison).
Implements both **full** and **reduced** integration to avoid shear-locking.

The beam is loaded with a concentrated moment and vertical load at its free end.
