# Finite-Element Galerkin Formulation for Timoshenko Beam

Finite-element Galerkin formulation of a cantilever beam, loaded with a concentrated moment and vertical force at its free edge.
The formulation applies Timoshenko's theory and Implements both **full** and **reduced** integration to avoid shear-locking.

The solution is validated by convergence towards an Euler-Bernoulli solution.
